    {LogoClim} is a NetLogo model for simulating and visualizing global climate
    conditions. It allows researchers to integrate high-resolution climate data
    into agent-based models, supporting reproducible research in ecology,
    agriculture, environmental sciences, and other fields that rely on climate
    data.
